#abstract
In main idea of the Canadian election survey is to show the main reasons for they way people vote for the candidates. According to this survey, it also invests the similarity and the difference of the voting in Canada and in other country. Furthermore, the result of the survey contributes to the science knowledge of the motivation of the voters and the meaning of the election. Moreover, the information of altitude and opinions of the Canadian citizens on social, economic, and political issues can be provided to public. 
In the survey, we analysis the subset of 2016 statistic Canada of Education Census. The table provides education data from Census of population according tot eh geographic and year. 

#introduction
In 2019 October 13th, the 43th Canadian federal election was held and Justin Trudeau became the new Prime Minster Canada. As a member of the Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau won 157 seats from the government. In Canada, in 37,802,043 people who have right to vote, 66% of the population voted for the election. However, there are still nearly 33% of the people who did not vote.
In this report, we will build a MRP model base on the CES data and post-stratification data. If 100% of the people who have the right to vote voted for the Election in 2019. The Prime Minster Justin Trudeau will have more supporting rate during the election. 
The 2019 CES data and ---- was chosen to investigate the result.  The result of the survey data shows that the substantial influence on the Canadian Election on the Canadian president candidates.  Voting and elections are the most basic elements of democracy. The CES has recorded Canadiansâ€™ political behaviour and altitudes and the preference on the key political issues. The study aims to explore the important results of the Canadian election if all the people voted for the election.

#model
The purpose of our study is to predict the vote outcome of the 2910 Canadian Election Survey in CES
dataset We used multilevel regression and post-stratification technique for this analysis. In the following sub-sections I will describe the model specifics and the calculation for the post-stratification process.

#result
Using a binary logistic model, we got two summary statistics tables and the probability of voting for
the Canadian Election. The data for fully voted person was summarized in the first table. The education level, age and gender are also mentioned.
